Life is Full of Inspiration
===========================

Life is Full of Inspiration is a cross-platform desktop video game written in
Java. The game was developed for the first official Game Dev Underground Jim Jam
(https://itch.io/jam/jimjam) in approximately 48 hours. It's just a really
casual riddle game, but it ties well into the jam's theme, which was
inspiration. The reward for solving each riddle is a picture that my wife and I
have taken at some point since getting married. Basically, the lesson I'm trying
to teach is that inspiration can be found everywhere around you; you just have
to be willing to get up and experience life.
